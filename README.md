
Better Configurations for Large-Scale Systems (BestConfig)
====================================

Bestconfig can find better configurations for a specific large-scale system under a given application workload.

Given the diverse application workloads, a large-scale system with hundreds of configuration parameters, such as Spark, 
Hadoop, Cassandra, MySQL and Tomcat, does not necessarily offer the best performance under their default configurations.

Currently, Bestconfig has been tested on the following systems. It has also been applied to the Huawei Cloud+ applications.

>>>[Cassandra: results](https://github.com/zhuyuqing/bestconf/blob/master/doc/cassandra.md)

>>>[Hive+Hadoop: results](https://github.com/zhuyuqing/bestconf/blob/master/doc/hadoop.md)

>>>[Tomcat Server: results](https://github.com/zhuyuqing/bestconf/blob/master/doc/tomcat.md)

>>>[MySQL: results](https://github.com/zhuyuqing/bestconf/blob/master/doc/mysql.md)

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the [latest release of BestConfig](https://github.com/zhuyuqing/bestconf/archive/master.zip):

    ```sh
    curl -O --location https://github.com/zhuyuqing/bestconf/archive/master.zip
    unzip bestconf-master.zip
    cd bestconf-master/deploy
    ```
    
2. Set up a system for tuning. In the project, we offer deployable examples for 6 systems, including Spark, 
   Hive+Hadoop, Cassandra, MySQL, and Tomcat. We also specify the workload generators to be used for tuning
   the systems.
   
3. Run BestConfig. 

    On Linux:
    Update all system and deployment related scripts accordingly and move them to the
    correct path on the servers.
    Move the system-specific jar file to lib. (For example, move deploy/4BI/bestconfBI.jar
    to deploy/lib)
    ```sh
    cd deploy
    bin/start.sh
    ```

#### Slides (in Chinese) on how to use BestConfig can also be downloaded following this [link](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx6aHV5dXFpbmd8Z3g6NmI1ZTYxMDc2N2FiOWMwNQ).

#### Or, if you would like to adapt BestConfig for your own application scenarios, you could follow our steps in [QuickStart](https://github.com/zhuyuqing/bestconf/blob/master/doc/QuickStart.md)
