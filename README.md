
Better Configurations for Large-Scale Systems (BestConfig)
====================================

[Documentation](http://bestconfig.readthedocs.io) | [QuickStart](http://bestconfig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/how%20to%20apply/index_howtoapply.html) | [Use cases](http://bestconfig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/examples/index_usecase.html) | [FAQ](http://bestconfig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/faq/index_faq.html) 

BestConfig is a system for automatically finding a best configuration setting within a resource limit for a deployed system under a given application workload. BestConfig is designed with an extensible architecture to automate the configuration tuning for general systems.

Currently, Bestconfig has been tested on the following systems. It has also been applied to the Huawei Cloud+ applications.
>>>Spark (large-scale data processing engine)
    
>>>Hadoop (distributed processing framework for big data)
    
Hive (big data warehouse)
    
    >>> MySQL (database)
    
    >>> Cassandra (NoSQL DB)
    
    >>> Tomcat (Web Server).

What’s New
-----------

#### Slides (in Chinese) on how to use BestConfig can also be downloaded following this [link](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx6aHV5dXFpbmd8Z3g6NmI1ZTYxMDc2N2FiOWMwNQ).

Building from source
